Hydraulic deterioration restricts groundwater flow into a tunnel and increases water pressure resulting in detrimental effects on the tunnel lining. Hydraulic deterioration of tunnel drainage system is unique in terms of clogging materials, deterioration mechanism, and flow conditions. Current studies and models investigating the clogging mechanism and hydraulic deterioration are not directly applicable to the geotextile filter of the tunnel drainage system. In this study, a theoretical model of the hydraulic deterioration of tunnel geotextile filter has been proposed considering the mechanical and hydraulic behavior of blinding, clogging and squeezing. A parametric study was carried out to evaluate the performance of the model. An experimental study has been conducted to investigate the clogging behavior of the tunnel drainage system and validate the theoretical model. Several types of clogging materials were selected: cement-leaching calcium oxide, calcium carbonate, iron oxide, and bentonite. Agglutinated clogging was mainly observed during the short-term testing. The findings suggest that the in-plane permeability of the geotextile filter decreased by approximately 90%. The proposed model corroborated the experimental results.</p><p><br></p><p>由于土工织物滤层的水力劣化，隧道排水系统的泄流量一般随时间而减小。水力恶化会限制地下水流入隧道，并增加水压，对隧道衬砌造成不利影响。隧道排水系统水力劣化在堵塞物、劣化机理、水流条件等方面具有独特性。目前研究隧道排水系统中土工织物滤层堵塞机理和水力劣化的研究和模型并不直接适用于隧道排水系统中的土工织物滤层。在本研究中，我们提出了一个隧道土工织物过滤器水力劣化的理论模型，考虑了堵塞、堵塞和挤压的力学和水力特性。为了评估模型的性能，进行了参数化研究。对隧道排水系统的堵塞特性进行了试验研究，验证了理论模型的正确性。选择了几种类型的堵塞材料：水泥浸出氧化钙、碳酸钙、氧化铁和膨润土。在短期试验中主要观察到凝集堵塞现象。研究结果表明，土工织物过滤器的面内渗透性降低了约90%。该模型验证了实验结果。</p><h1 class=pgc-h-arrow-right>Investigation of tensile strength on alkaline treated and untreated kenaf geotextile under dry and wet conditions</h1><p>Geosynthetics or geotextile is used for aggregate separation, soil reinforcement, filtration, drainage and moisture or liquid barriers in geotechnical applications. Because of the environmental issues, a bio-based material is introduced as a sustainable construction material. The kenaf fibre is a bio-based material available in the tropical countries. It can be potentially used as a geotextile because of its high tensile strength. This paper presents the tensile strength characteristics of kenaf geotextile, manufactured with and without sodium hydroxide (NaOH) treatment. The tensile strength of kenaf geotextile was determined by using the wide-width strip test based on the ASTM D4595-17 standard. Because the kenaf fibre has a high water absorption capability, the effect of wet and dry conditions on tensile behaviour of kenaf textile was studied. Two patterns of woven kenaf with two different opening sizes between their yarns (0 × 0 and 2 × 2 mm)—plain and incline patterns were studied. In addition, the tensile strength of the kenaf geotextiles, buried in natural ground, was examined after a one-year period. The tensile strength of kenaf geotextiles was higher for the smaller spaces between the yarns. Furthermore, the tensile strength and elongation were lower under wet condition. The alkaline treatment (6% concentration of NaOH) significantly improved the tensile strength of the woven kenaf geotextile. The tensile strength of the treated kenaf geotextile was higher than that of the untreated one, for both short and long-term conditions, showing the advantage of NaOH treatment.</p><p><br></p><p>土工合成材料或土工织物用于岩土工程应用中的集料分离、土壤加固、过滤、排水和水分或液体屏障。由于环境问题，生物基材料被引入作为一种可持续的建筑材料。红麻纤维是一种在热带国家可用的生物基材料。由于其高拉伸强度，可作为土工织物使用。本文介绍了用氢氧化钠和氢氧化钠处理的红麻土工织物的抗拉强度特性。根据ASTM D4595-17标准，采用宽幅条带试验测定红麻土工布的拉伸强度。由于红麻纤维具有较高的吸水性，研究了干湿条件对红麻织物拉伸性能的影响。研究了两种不同开口尺寸（0 × 0和2 × 2 mm）红麻机织物的平纹和斜纹图案。此外，在一年后，对埋在天然地基中的红麻土工织物的拉伸强度进行了检测。红麻土工织物纱线间距越小，拉伸强度越高。此外，湿态下的拉伸强度和延伸率较低。碱处理（6%氢氧化钠浓度）显著提高了红麻机织土工布的拉伸强度。在短期和长期条件下，处理后的红麻土工织物的拉伸强度均高于未处理的红麻土工织物，显示了NaOH处理的优越性。</p><p><br></p><h1 class=pgc-h-arrow-right>Geotextile clogging at different stages of municipal solid waste landfills co-disposed with bottom ash</h1><p>Co-disposal of bottom ash (BA) with municipal solid waste (MSW) in landfills is a common way for BA management. However, BA co-disposal in MSW landfills may accelerate geotextile clogging and reduce the performance of leachate collection system. This study compared geotextile clogging in a simulated MSW landfill leachate (MSWL) and a BA co-disposed landfill leachate (BAL) at different landfill stages. Geotextile clogging test was conducted using the MSWL and BAL taken from the simulated landfills on the 10th, 80th, 140th and 200th day, respectively. The results demonstrated that geotextile clogging varied with landfill age, due to the change of leachate characteristics. The mass of clogging material in geotextiles with BAL increased from 0.45 g to 2.74 g, which was 43.87%–63.73% greater than those with MSWL. The formation of biofilm was the main contributor for the geotextile clogging. At the same stage, the amount of biofilm formed on geotextile in different leachate was comparable. However, the amounts of CaCO3 precipitation on geotextile in BAL were 3.85–10.44 times of those in MSW leachate. The pH of leachate played a critical role in CaCO3 precipitation. The microbial analysis revealed that the co-disposal of the BA greatly influenced the microbial community diversity and structure.</p><p>垃圾填埋场底灰（BA）与城市生活垃圾（MSW）共处置是垃圾填埋场底灰管理的常用方法。但是，垃圾填埋场中的BA-co处理会加速土工织物的堵塞，降低渗滤液收集系统的性能。比较了模拟垃圾渗滤液（MSWL）和BA共处理垃圾渗滤液（BAL）在不同填埋阶段土工织物的堵塞情况。分别于10日、80日、140日和200日对模拟填埋场的MSWL和BAL进行土工布堵塞试验。结果表明，由于渗滤液特性的变化，土工织物的堵塞随填埋年限的变化而变化。BAL土工织物中的堵塞物质量由0.45 g增加到2.74 g，比MSWL土工织物大43.87%-63.73%。生物膜的形成是土工织物堵塞的主要原因。在同一阶段，不同渗滤液在土工织物上形成的生物膜量具有可比性。然而，BAL土工织物上的CaCO3沉淀量是垃圾渗滤液中CaCO3沉淀量的3.85-10.44倍。渗滤液的pH值对碳酸钙的析出起着关键作用。微生物分析表明，BA的共处理对微生物群落的多样性和结构有很大的影响。</p><p><br></p><h1 class=pgc-h-arrow-right>A short-term model for extrapolating unconfined creep deformation data for woven geotextiles</h1><p><br></p><p>This study reports results for creep deformation with data acquired in 72 h of testing. A system capable of performing 8 simultaneous tests was used to test four woven geotextiles of different weights, following all of the recommendations outlined in the standards related to equipment setup. A mathematical model was used to generate time-dependent creep curves for four different load levels up to 40% for each sample and using a database which presented stage II creep conditions (i.e. without rupture) through the end of the tests, up to 10,000 h. The coefficients of variation for the conventional creep tests were below 10%. The compatibility between the experimental data and the model indicates that short-term (72 h) loading tests may be used to extrapolate long-term creep deformation in woven geotextiles.</p><p>本文用72小时的试验数据报告了蠕变变形结果。根据与设备设置相关的标准中概述的所有建议，使用一个能够同时进行8次试验的系统来试验四种不同重量的编织土工布。采用数学模型生成了四种不同荷载水平下的随时间变化的蠕变曲线，每个试样的蠕变曲线高达40%，并使用了一个数据库，该数据库在试验结束时提供了高达10000 h的第二阶段蠕变条件（即无破裂）。常规蠕变试验的变化系数低于10%。试验数据与模型的相容性表明，短期（72 h）加载试验可用于推断机织土工织物的长期蠕变变形。</p><p><br></p><h1 class=pgc-h-arrow-right>Geotextile filtration opening size under tension and confinement</h1><p>Nonwoven geotextiles have been used as filters in geotechnical and geoenvironmental works for half a century. They are easy to install and can be specified to meet the requirements for proper filter performance. There are situations where a geotextile filter may be subjected to tensile loads, which may alter relevant filter properties, such as its filtration opening size. Examples of such situations are silty fence applications, geotextile separators, geotextile tubes and geotextiles under embankments on soft soils. This paper investigates the effects of tensile strains on geotextile pore dimensions. A special equipment and testing technique allowed tests to be carried out on geotextile specimens subjected to tension and confinement. The results obtained showed that the variation in filtration opening size depends on the type of strain state the geotextile is subjected, under which the geotextile pore diameter may remain rather constant or increase significantly. However, confinement reduces the geotextile filtration opening size independent on the strain mobilised. An upper bound for the filtration opening size of strained nonwoven geotextiles is introduced and was satisfactory for the geotextile products tested.</p><p>非织造土工织物在岩土工程和地质环境工程中用作滤料已有半个世纪了。它们易于安装，并且可以指定以满足适当过滤器性能的要求。在某些情况下，土工织物过滤器可能会受到拉伸载荷，这可能会改变相关的过滤器性能，例如其过滤开口尺寸。此类情况的例子包括粉质围栏应用、土工织物分离器、土工织物管和软土路堤下的土工织物。本文研究了拉伸应变对土工织物孔隙尺寸的影响。一种特殊的设备和测试技术允许对承受张力和限制的土工织物试样进行测试。结果表明，过滤孔径的变化取决于土工织物的应变状态类型，在应变状态下，土工织物的孔径可以保持相当恒定或显著增大。然而，限制降低了土工织物的过滤开口尺寸，这与应变的动员无关。介绍了应变非织造土工布过滤开度的上限值，并对试验土工布产品进行了验证。</p><p><br></p><h1 class=pgc-h-arrow-right>Evaluation of moisture reduction in aggregate base by wicking geotextile using soil column tests</h1><p>This study investigated the distance effect on water reduction by the wicking geotextile in a base course experimentally using three sets of soil column tests. In each set of tests, two soil columns were constructed by compacting well-graded aggregate over a non-wicking woven geotextile and a wicking geotextile. A portion of the geotextile specimen was extended outside of the soil column for evaporation. The changes of the water contents in the soil column were monitored by volumetric water content sensors installed at various depths. The experimental results indicate the capillary drainage by the wicking geotextile effectively reduced water content within the soil column up to a distance from the wicking geotextile (i.e., approximately 200 mm for this specific aggregate with 10% fines). The test results also show that the wicking geotextile could reduce more water content of the aggregate below its optimum water content at a faster rate than the non-wicking geotextile.</p><p>通过三组土柱试验，研究了芯吸土工布在基层中对减水的距离效应。在每一组试验中，通过在无芯编织土工布和芯编织土工布上压实级配良好的骨料来建造两个土柱。将一部分土工织物试样伸出土柱外蒸发。采用不同深度的容积式含水量传感器监测土柱含水量的变化。实验结果表明，毛细土工织物的毛细排水有效地减少了土壤柱内的水含量，达到距毛细土工织物的距离（即，对于这种特定骨料，约10%μm，约10%μm）。试验结果还表明，芯吸土工布比不芯吸土工布能以更快的速度将集料的含水量降到最佳含水量以下。</p><h1 class=pgc-h-arrow-right>Comparison of the behaviour of various geotextiles used in the filtration of clayey sludge: An experimental study</h1><p><br></p><p>This paper presents the results of an experimental study of various geotextiles used to filter clayey sludge. The use of geotextiles to filter clayey sludge or suspensions of fine particles in water is more complex than that for filtering suspensions of granular soils. In practice, such applications generally use flocculants to postpone the formation of a low-permeability filter cake. The objective of the present study, which does not use flocculants, is to determine how geotextile characteristics affect the capacity of the geotextile to filter clayey sludge. Three key questions are addressed: (1) What are the main differences between vertical and horizontal filtration? (2) How do geotextile characteristics (nature, opening size, permeability, etc.) affect its capacity to filter clayey sludge (3) How do clayey sludge characteristics (i.e., grain size distribution and concentration)? and the type of flow (i.e., constant head or constant flow) affect the filtering capacity of geotextiles? To evaluate the capacity of a geotextile to filter clayey sludge, we propose three relevant criteria and analyse two filtration phases induced by different cake-formation processes (controlled by the geotextile and controlled by the filter cake). To determine the main differences between vertical and horizontal filtration, the settling of fines in the testing device and its influence on the results are analysed and discussed. This study shows that, for the various clayey sludge tested, the geotextiles (needle-punched nonwoven and thermally bonded nonwoven) with the smallest opening sizes (O90 ≤ 60 μm) give the most promising results for filtering fines without the use of flocculants. Of these geotextiles, the thermally bonded nonwoven structure seems to offer the best filtration performance for the largest range of fines concentration in the sludge.</p><p>本文介绍了各种土工织物过滤粘性污泥的试验研究结果。使用土工织物过滤水中的粘质污泥或细颗粒悬浮物比过滤粒状土壤悬浮物更为复杂。在实际应用中，此类应用通常使用絮凝剂来延缓低渗透滤饼的形成。本研究不使用絮凝剂，目的是确定土工织物特性如何影响土工织物过滤粘性污泥的能力。提出了三个关键问题：（1）垂直过滤和水平过滤的主要区别是什么？（2） 土工织物特性（性质、开口尺寸、渗透性等）如何影响其过滤粘性污泥的能力（3）粘性污泥特性（即粒度分布和浓度）如何？流量类型（即恒定水头或恒定流量）影响土工织物的过滤能力？为了评价土工织物对粘性污泥的过滤能力，我们提出了三个相关的准则，并分析了不同滤饼形成过程（土工织物控制和滤饼控制）引起的两个过滤阶段。为了确定垂直过滤和水平过滤的主要区别，对试验装置中细颗粒的沉降及其对结果的影响进行了分析和讨论。研究表明，对于不同的泥质污泥，孔径最小（O90 ≤ 60 μm）的土工织物（针刺非织造布和热粘合非织造布）在不使用絮凝剂的情况下过滤细颗粒时，效果最好。在这些土工织物中，热粘合非织造布结构似乎为污泥中最大范围的细粒浓度提供了最佳过滤性能。</p><h1 class=pgc-h-arrow-right>Spectrophotometry as a tool for characterizing durability of woven geotextiles</h1><p>Geotextiles are used in numerous applications ranging from coastal hydraulic projects to geotechnical landfill projects. Durability studies are necessary for the sizing of these structures since these projects are subject to aggressive weathering. Therefore, it is important to be able to rapidly evaluate the rate of degradation of the geotextile, without detriment to the project. For traditional tests of geosynthetics, large areas must be exhumed, therefore a test which makes use of small specimens is proposed: spectrophotometry. The procedure proposed here makes use of electromagnetic radiation to evaluate the degradation of woven geotextiles by means of analysis of ultraviolet and infrared absorption. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the analysis of geotextile materials by spectrophotometry, making comparisons between laboratory and field degradation. The analyses and correlations were demonstrated to be satisfactory for characterization of degraded geotextiles. The results, with respect to both the absorbance of ultraviolet and transmittance of infrared, yielded both qualitative and quantitative characterizations of the behavior of the studied material. Therefore, spectrophotometry may be considered viable alternative for evaluating the characterization of durability in exhumed samples.</p><p>土工织物被广泛应用于从沿海水利工程到岩土填埋工程的各个领域。耐久性研究对于确定这些结构的尺寸是必要的，因为这些项目受到侵蚀性风化的影响。因此，能够在不影响工程的情况下，快速评估土工织物的降解速率是非常重要的。对于传统的土工合成材料试验，必须大面积挖出，因此提出了一种利用小试样的试验方法：分光光度法。利用电磁辐射对土工织物进行紫外和红外吸收分析，评价土工织物的降解性能。本研究的目的是用分光光度法对土工织物材料进行分析，比较实验室和现场降解情况。这些分析和关联式对于降解土工织物的表征是令人满意的。从紫外吸收率和红外透过率两方面对所研究材料的行为进行了定性和定量表征。因此，分光光度法可被认为是评估挖掘样品耐久性特征的可行替代方法。</p><h1 class=pgc-h-arrow-right>Strength enhancement of geotextile-reinforced carbonate sand</h1><p>The mechanical behavior of carbonate sand reinforced with horizontal layers of geotextile is invetigated using a series of drained compression triaxial tests on unreinforced and reinforced samples. The main factors affecting the mechanical behavior such as the number of geotextile layers, their arrangement in specimens, confining pressure, particle size distribution, geotextile type and relative density of samples were examined and discussed in this research. To make a precise comparison between the behavior of reinforced siliceous and carbonate sand, triaxial tests were performed on both types of sands. Results indicate that geotextile inclusion increases the peak strength and strain at failure, and significantly reduces the post-peak strength loss of carbonate specimens. The amount of strength enhancement rises as the number of geotextile layers increases while two other parameters including confining pressure and particle size affect adversely. The strength enhancement of reinforced carbonate sand is greater than the corresponding siliceous sample at high axial strains. Reinforced and unreinforced carbonate specimens exhibit more contractive behavior than their corresponding siliceous samples and tend to dilate at higher axial strains. By increasing the relative density of the samples, the peak strength of reinforced specimens rises due to enhanced interlocking between geotextile layers and sand particles. This process continues as long as the geotextile is not ruptured. The utilization of geotextiles with high mass per unit areas was found to be uneconomical due to slight differences between the strength augmentation of geotextiles with high and low mass per unit areas. It should be noted that geotextile layers limit the lateral expansion of specimens which leads to changing the failure pattern from a shear plane to bulging between the adjacent layers of geotextile.</p><p>采用非加筋和加筋试样的一系列排水压缩三轴试验研究了土工织物水平层增强的碳酸盐砂的力学行为。对影响土工织物力学性能的主要因素，如土工织物层数、试样排列方式、围压、粒径分布、土工织物类型、试样相对密度等进行了研究和探讨。为了对硅质砂和碳酸盐砂的行为进行精确的比较，对这两种类型的砂土进行了三轴试验。结果表明，土工织物包裹体提高了碳酸盐岩试件的峰值强度和破坏应变，显著降低了峰后强度损失。随着土工织物层数的增加，土工织物的强度增强量增加，而围压和粒径等其他两个参数对土工织物的强度有不利影响。在高轴向应变下，增强的碳酸盐砂的强度增强大于相应的硅质样品。增强的和未增强的碳酸盐试样表现出比它们相应的硅质样品更多的收缩行为，并且倾向于在较高的轴向应变下膨胀。通过增加试样的相对密度，由于土工织物层与砂粒之间的互锁作用增强，增强试样的峰值强度增加。只要土工织物没有破裂，这个过程就会继续。由於单位面积高质量土工织物和单位面积低质量土工织物的强度增强略有不同，因此使用单位面积高质量土工织物是不经济的。应注意的是，土工织物层限制了试样的侧向膨胀，从而导致破坏模式从剪切面改变为相邻土工织物层之间的膨胀。</p><h1 class=pgc-h-arrow-right>Using a geotextile with flocculated filter backwash water and its impact on aluminium concentrations</h1><p>The use of geotextiles (i.e. geotextile tubes) in wastewater treatment applications is ever increasing. This paper examines the potential of using a geotextile to improve upon the treatment of aluminium present in a filter backwash water that is generated from a water treatment plant in Halifax, Canada. A field investigation to ascertain the distribution of aluminium in the filter backwash water treatment process is provided and compared to regulatory guidelines at the environmental compliance point. It is shown that aluminium is undergoing incomplete treatment at various times throughout the year. To examine a potential corrective action, the results of bench scale studies are presented in which cationic additives (i.e. CaO, MgO, and Fe3O4) are combined with a polymer to remove aluminium from solution and flocculate particulate matter from the filter backwash water. A geotextile is utilized to retain particulate matter generated from this process. It is shown that the combined use of the cationic additive with polymer can successfully reduce aluminium concentrations in the filter backwash water and that filtration via a geotextile can retain the aluminium particulate in the filter backwash water to levels close to regulatory requirements. Further optimization with the flocculation process is recommended prior to pilot testing.</p><p>土工织物（即土工织物管）在废水处理中的应用越来越多。本文探讨了使用土工布改善加拿大哈利法克斯一家水处理厂产生的过滤器反冲洗水中铝的处理的潜力。提供了现场调查，以确定过滤器反冲洗水处理过程中铝的分布，并与环境合规点的监管指南进行了比较。结果表明，铝在一年中的不同时期都处于不完全处理状态。为了检验一种潜在的纠正措施，提出了将阳离子添加剂（即CaO、MgO和Fe3O4）与聚合物结合以去除溶液中的铝和絮凝过滤器反冲洗水中的颗粒物的实验室研究结果。土工织物用于保留此过程中产生的颗粒物。结果表明，阳离子添加剂与聚合物的联合使用可以成功地降低滤池反冲洗水中的铝浓度，通过土工布过滤可以将滤池反冲洗水中的铝颗粒保持在接近监管要求的水平。在中试之前，建议进一步优化絮凝工艺。</p><h1 class=pgc-h-arrow-right>Biodegradable geotextiles – An overview of existing and potential materials</h1><p>Geotextiles are a group of mostly thermoplastic polymers, which are processed to flexible material sheets, and are installed on various landscapes for reinforcing or protective purposes. Most applied materials in the field are non-degradable polymers, such as polyolefins or polyesters, which can implicate environmental problems concerning soil pollution and accumulation of micro plastics. Because of these drawbacks, for some applications time-consuming re-collection of the material becomes necessary. Hence, the development of more environmentally friendly and biodegradable geotextiles is of interest for several application purposes. In this review biodegradable alternatives to the conventional polymeric geotextile fibers are discussed. In general, there are two material classes available, which are natural fibers and biodegradable polymers. While there is already quite a number of natural-fiber-based geotextiles available on the market, the idea of applying industrial biopolymers for this purpose is relatively unexplored. Geotextile fabrics, made of plant fibers, represent a promising approach and were already successfully installed in several applications. However, the use of natural fibers also entails some limitations regarding water uptake and stability. Therefore, the potential use of a different material class, which comprises degradable, thermoplastic biopolymers, is discussed in this overview as well. There is only little information available on the use of these biopolymers in connection with geotextiles, thus their suitability regarding biodegradation, price and mechanical properties were evaluated.</p><p>土工布是一组主要是热塑性聚合物，它们被加工成柔性材料片材，并安装在各种景观上以增强或保护目的。该领域的应用材料大多是不可降解的聚合物，如聚烯烃或聚酯，这可能涉及到与土壤污染和微型塑料积聚有关的环境问题。由于这些缺点，对于某些应用程序来说，耗时的重新收集材料变得非常必要。因此，开发更环保和可生物降解的土工织物具有多个应用目的。本文综述了传统高分子土工织物纤维的生物可降解替代物。一般来说，有两种可用的材料类别，即天然纤维和可生物降解聚合物。虽然市场上已经有相当多的天然纤维土工织物可供选择，但将工业生物聚合物用于这一目的的想法还相对未被探索。由植物纤维制成的土工织物是一种很有前途的方法，已经成功地应用于多种应用中。然而，天然纤维的使用也会在吸水性和稳定性方面受到一些限制。因此，本综述也讨论了包括可降解热塑性生物聚合物的不同材料类别的潜在用途。关于这些生物聚合物在土工织物中的应用，目前只有很少的资料，因此对它们在生物降解、价格和机械性能方面的适用性进行了评估。</p><h1 class=pgc-h-arrow-right>Reclamation of abandoned open mines with innovative meandrically arranged geotextiles</h1><p>For over fifty years, geosynthetics have been used for land reclamation of degraded areas. Several years ago for this purpose innovative geotextiles formed from meandrically arranged thick ropes were invented. The geotextiles were used for reclamation of abandoned lignite open-mine in Germany and disused gravel pit in Poland. The geotextiles were installed in abandoned mines. In next years positive influence of geotextiles on slopes behaviour and vegetation was observed. It was stated that the geotextiles provide stabilization of steep unstable slopes and significantly accelerate vegetation development. The innovative geotextiles perform functions unobtainable for other traditional products.

The most common method for BA treatment is co-disposal with MSW in landfills, which may cause clogging in the leachate collection system (LCS). This research investigated the characteristics of geotextile clogging in landfills with BA co-disposal. The co-disposal of BA changed the characteristics of leachate, especially increasing the concentration of Ca2+. During the experiment, 0.14 g CaCO3 was precipitated in the MSW geotextile, while it increased to 0.52 g CaCO3 in the BA co-disposed geotextile. Based on mass balance of calcium and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, the formation of biofilm was the main contributor to the mass increment, accounting for about 82% and 57% mass increment in the MSW and BA co-disposed geotextile, respectively. Moreover, CO2 in landfill gas played an important role in the clogging process, including CaCO3 precipitation and biofilm formation. The results suggested that the co-disposal of BA with MSW can increase the risk of geotextile clogging in landfills.</p><p>底灰作为城市生活垃圾焚烧处理的主要副产品，已成为垃圾焚烧厂运行中的一大挑战。垃圾填埋场中BA处理最常用的方法是与MSW共同处理，这可能导致渗滤液收集系统（LCS）堵塞。研究了BA-co处理垃圾填埋场土工织物的堵塞特性。BA的协同处理改变了渗滤液的特性，特别是提高了Ca2+的浓度。在试验过程中，MSW土工织物中析出了0.14 g碳酸钙，BA共处理土工织物中的碳酸钙含量增加到0.52 g。根据钙的质量平衡和热重（TG）分析，生物膜的形成是质量增量的主要贡献者，分别占MSW和BA共处理土工织物质量增量的82%和57%。此外，填埋气中的CO2在堵塞过程中起着重要作用，包括CaCO3的沉淀和生物膜的形成。结果表明，垃圾填埋场中BA与MSW共同处理会增加土工织物的堵塞风险。</p><p><br></p><h1 class=pgc-h-arrow-right>Degradation of polypropylene geotextiles with different chemical stabilisations in marine environments</h1><p>The geosynthetics applied in coastal engineering structures can be in contact with degradation agents capable of causing unwanted changes in their properties. In this work, three nonwoven polypropylene geotextiles with different stabilisation packages (different known amounts of Chimassorb 944 and carbon black) were exposed in situ to some degradation agents present in marine environments (weathering, seawater and action of tides). These exposures were carried out in Portugal (Archipelago of the Azores) and lasted for 36 months. The damage suffered by the geotextiles (in the different degradation tests) was evaluated quantitatively by monitoring changes in their physical (mass per unit area and thickness) and mechanical (tensile behaviour) properties. The results, among other findings, showed that: (1) weathering led to the highest damage in the geotextiles, (2) the weathering resistance of the geotextiles was highly enhanced by Chimassorb 944 and carbon black, (3) the geotextiles had a good resistance against the action of seawater and (4) the algae and dirt accumulated in the nonwoven structures during the exposure to the action of tides protected the geotextiles from UV-degradation (sunblind effect).α, confidence level; C944, Chimassorb 944; Δt, variation of thickness; ΔμA, variation of mass per unit area; EML, elongation at maximum load; n, number of specimens; PP, polypropylene; RTS, retained tensile strength; s, sample standard deviation; t, Student's t-distribution value; t, thickness; T, tensile strength; tExposed, thickness of exposed samples; TExposed, tensile strength of exposed samples; tReference, thickness of reference samples (undamaged); TReference, tensile strength of reference samples (undamaged); μ, population mean; μA, mass per unit area; μA Exposed, mass per unit area of exposed samples; μA Reference, mass per unit area of reference samples (undamaged); UV, ultraviolet; x, sample mean</p><p>应用于海岸工程结构的土工合成材料可能会与降解剂接触，而降解剂会导致其性能发生不必要的变化。在这项工作中，三种具有不同稳定包装（不同已知量的Chimassorb 944和炭黑）的非织造聚丙烯土工布在现场暴露于海洋环境中存在的一些降解剂（风化、海水和潮汐作用）。这些曝光是在葡萄牙（亚速尔群岛）进行的，持续了36个月。通过监测土工织物的物理（单位面积和厚度的质量）和机械（拉伸性能）性能的变化，定量评估土工织物（在不同的降解试验中）遭受的损伤。结果表明：（1）风化作用对土工织物的损伤最大，（2）赤霉素944和炭黑能显著提高土工织物的耐候性，（3） 土工织物具有良好的抗海水作用和（4）暴露在潮汐作用下非织造布结构中积聚的藻类和污垢保护土工织物免受紫外线降解（遮阳效应）。α，置信水平；C944，Chimassorb 944；Δt，厚度变化；Δμa，单位面积质量的变化；最大载荷下的伸长率；N；试样数量；聚丙烯；聚丙烯；RTS；残余拉伸强度；s；试样标准偏差；T；学生的t值；T；厚度；T；抗拉强度；厚度；暴露样品的厚度；TExposed；暴露样品的抗拉强度，参考样品的厚度（未损坏）；Trereference，参考样品的拉伸强度（未损坏）；μ，总体平均值；μA，单位面积质量；μA，暴露样品单位面积质量；μA reference，参考样品单位面积质量（未损坏）；UV，紫外线；x，样品平均值</p><h1 class=pgc-h-arrow-right>Influence of geotextile arrangement on seismic performance of mid-rise buildings subjected to MCE shaking</h1><p>Geotextile layers make it possible to construct mid-rise buildings sitting on shallow foundations in unfavourable soil conditions; this study investigates how the arrangement of geotextiles affects the seismic performance of mid-rise buildings under Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE) shaking. The geotextile arrangement considered here includes the stiffness (5000 kN/m – 12000 kN/m), the length with respect to width of the foundation (B) (1B – 4B), the number of geotextile layers (1 – 7 layers), and their spacing (250 mm – 1000 mm). FLAC3D is used for the numerical simulation and to carry out nonlinear dynamic analysis in the time domain, and an inelastic constitutive model is used to simulate the behaviour of the structure and the geotextile layers under seismic loads. Variations in the shear modulus of soil and the corresponding damping ratio with cyclic shear strain are considered using a hysteretic damping algorithm to model the reasonable dissipation of energy in the soil. The interface between the foundation and ground surface, including the material and geometrical nonlinearities, are used to capture any possible slide and uplift in the foundations. The results are presented with regard to the geotextile arrangement considered, and include the tensile force mobilised in the geotextile layers, the response spectra at the bedrock and ground surface, the shear force developed in the structure, the maximum rocking angle of the foundation, permanent foundation settlement, maximum lateral displacement and the maximum and residual inter-storey drifts. The results show that the geotextile layers close to the edges of the foundation sustained most of the stress induced by foundation rocking, and the geotextile arrangement has a significant influence on the seismic response of mid-rise buildings. Thus, to satisfy the seismic performance of buildings and to optimise the design of foundations reinforced with geotextiles, the stiffness, length, number and spacing of the geotextile layers should be designed with great care.</p><p>土工织物层可以在不利的土壤条件下建造浅基础的中高层建筑物；本研究探讨土工布的布置如何影响最大地震（MCE）振动下中高层建筑的抗震性能。这里考虑的土工织物布置包括刚度（5000×kn/m - 12000 kn/m）、相对于地基（b）（1b～4b）的宽度、土工织物层（1～7层）的数量、以及它们的间距（250×-mm×1000 mm）。采用FLAC3D进行数值模拟和时域非线性动力分析，采用非弹性本构模型模拟结构和土工织物层在地震荷载作用下的行为。采用滞回阻尼算法，考虑了土的剪切模量和相应的阻尼比随循环剪切应变的变化，建立了土中能量的合理耗散模型。基础和地面之间的界面，包括材料和几何非线性，用于捕捉地基中任何可能的滑动和隆起。结果表明，考虑土工织物布置，包括在土工织物层中调动的张力，基岩和地面的反应谱，在结构中发展的剪力，基础的最大摇摆角，永久地基沉降，最大横向位移和最大和残余层间漂移。结果表明，靠近地基边缘的土工织物层承受了基础摇摆引起的大部分应力，而土工布布置对中高层建筑的地震反应有显著影响。因此，为了满足建筑物的抗震性能，优化土工布加固地基的设计，应精心设计土工织物层的刚度、长度、数量和间距。</p></div><div class="post-meta meta-tags"><ul class=clearfix><li><a>'有关','织物','新文献'</a></li></ul></div></article></div></div><div id=secondary><section class=widget><form id=search action=//www.google.com/search method=get accept-charset=utf-8 target=_blank _lpchecked=1><input type=text name=q maxlength=20 placeholder=搜索>
