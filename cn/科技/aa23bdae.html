A similar type of company called “Coursera” was established with the purposes of making lectures from top-notch universities accessible to the public.</p><p>论述国家政策使出国留学变成可能</p><p>Compared with developed countries, China is undoubtedly left behind in many aspects including education. In the past, it is unimaginable that one could study abroad because of financial and political reasons. Fortunately, the situation has changed with the implementation of the new policy. More and more Chinese faces begin to appear in western universities.</p><p><strong>Q 20:</strong></p><p>Do you agree or disagree with following statement：the rules that the society today requires young people to follow and obey are too strict.</p><p>谈恋爱会不会影响学习的例子</p><p>For example, I have two classmates who are in love with each other. They study together, eat together and hanging out together with nobody standing in the way. Even so, they are still among the best in my class.</p><p>论证在找工作过程中的潜规则正逐渐淘汰</p><p>In my country, getting a decent job without using “backdoor policy” was once considered unimaginable. Whether a young person found a satisfying job or not depended on families’ social backgrounds, rather than real capabilities. Gradually, the public found out that the nepotism easily resulted in corruption, which could badly threaten the principle of social justice and fairness. Today’s young people are not confined to those “unwritten rules” behind the job-hunting.</p><p><img alt=托福写作问题大解刨：想举例子，但没有好的素材（Q16-21）？ onerror=errorimg.call(this); src=https://p3.pstatp.com/large/4e7b00048fb86e57dff3></p><p><strong>Q19:</strong></p><p>People who develop many different skills are more successful than people who focus on one skill only.</p><p>互联网冲击下的实体店</p><p>For example, having been impacted by online shopping, a large number of owners of physical stores have no choice but to facing a great decline in sales. In contrast, the owners who are good at doing business online are more likely to survive well.</p><p>多种技能给人们工作带来的优势</p><p>Taking my uncle for example, he is a successful salesman and no one is really better than him in sales performance. This is because apart from his skill in selling goods, he also has a good command of English that enables him to deal with overseas customers. Besides, his proficiency in reading people’s minds helps him to take an upper hand in negotiation.</p><p><strong>Q18:</strong></p><p>During economic crisis, which one of the following expenditures should be reduced by government: library, police or public transportation?</p><p>经济危机时期人们的表现</p><p>We can learn from history that financial crisis always comes along with riots and turmoil. Confronted with unemployment, bankruptcy and the decline in living standards, people are likely to swarm into the street to protest against the government.</p><p>经济时期政府的措施</p><p>For example, in order to get over the economic crisis as soon as possible, the government must take measures to revitalize the economy by encouraging people to go around in search of new business opportunities, or attracting foreign investments.</p><p><img alt=托福写作问题大解刨：想举例子，但没有好的素材（Q16-21）？ onerror=errorimg.call(this); src=https://p1.pstatp.com/large/4e7d00043dca24cc5d6e></p><p><strong>Q17:</strong></p><p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: in modern times, grandparents cannot give their grandchildren useful advice because the world of today are too different than it was in the past.</p><p>长辈对晚辈的帮助1</p><p>For example, in my high school, I was so-called a straight-A student, but once I screwed up a test by getting a score that kicked me out of top 10 in my class, which disappointed me so much. Hearing about my failure, my grandfather tried to cheer up by his true story about how to smash enemies’ fort after series of defeats when he was in the army. That inspirational story finally put me together.</p><p>长辈对晚辈的帮助2</p><p>Just imagine s scene that a young girl is dating with handsome-looking guy. However, after a family dinner, the girl’s grandma, by analyzing the man’s way of talking, told her that the man might have an inclination to use family violence. In this case, the advice of grandma surely can impede the girl from stepping into a risky relationship.</p><p>长辈的意见虽然过时，但仍有价值</p><p>Admittedly, under some circumstances, the advice of grandparents seems to be traditional and conservative. After all, their ways of looking at things are confined to their backgrounds that have somewhat fallen behind the times. However, when it comes to dealing with people or matter, grandparents’ advice really counts because they are the precious summary derived from lessons of successes and failures on their lifetime.</p><p><strong>Q16：</strong></p><p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:children should spend all their time studying and playing and they shouldn’t be required to help with household chores, such as cooking etc.</p><p>做家务的好处</p><p>For example, if a child wants to study abroad in the future, he or she needs a strong practical ability to survive such as washing clothes and cooking, because there is no one else to rely on.</p><p>不做家务的后果</p><p>A negative example is my cousin who only cares about himself and becomes aloof to his parents, which is probably caused by his absence in any type of household chores.</p></div></div><div class="post-meta meta-tags"><ul class=clearfix><li><a>'写作','问题','大解'</a></li></ul></div></article></div></div><div id=secondary><section class=widget><form id=search action=//www.google.com/search method=get accept-charset=utf-8 target=_blank _lpchecked=1><input type=text name=q maxlength=20 placeholder=搜索>
